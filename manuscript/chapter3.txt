# Chapter 3 - Connecting to Data

We now have a service that can handle basic HTTP requests, and respond with some placeholder data. This in itself . It is very likely that your application will need to talk to some kind of permanent data store in order to perform some meaningful work.

In this chapter we will connect our microservice to a Postgres database and retrieve data relative to a customer.

## Setting up the Database

We will need a database with example data to illustrate the working microservice. I will be using Postgres in this guide, but this could easily be done with another relational database, with the appropriate driver changes.

```sql
